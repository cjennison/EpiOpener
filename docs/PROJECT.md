This project is a custom overlay for ACT, an overlay tool for Final Fantasy XIV. It has to use ACT's guideline's for Custom Overlays and employ systems that work with it: https://github.com/FFXIV-ACT/setup-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-overlays

## Summary

This project is a minimal overlay that displays the Opener of any class in FFXIV and a selectable set of those openers. It is designed to assist users in executing their opener in all combat situations when combat begins and provides audio feedback for each successful opener action.

Some classes have multiple openers available, and users can select which one they wish to use. The overlay will then display the selected opener when the corresponding class is detected. Some encounters have modified openers due to fight mechanics, and users can select these modified openers as well. The system can detect what zone a player is in and adjust the opener accordingly.

Opener visuals look like the images generated by TheBalance with transparent backgrounds.

## Requirements

- The overlay must work within ACT's Custom Overlay system.
- The overlay must detect the player's current class and display the corresponding opener.
- The overlay must allow users to select from multiple openers for each class and when selected, stores that preference.
- The overlay must detect the current zone/encounter and adjust the opener displayed if a modified opener is available for that encounter.
- The overlay must provide audio feedback for each successful action in the opener sequence.
- The overlay must be visually appealing and easy to read, with clear indicators for each action in the opener.
- The overlay must be responsive and function correctly across different screen resolutions and sizes using ACT's drag and drop positioning system.
- The overlay must be lightweight and not impact game performance.
- The overlay timeline must support GCD and oGCD abilities, showing their proper timing and sequence.
- The overlay must include a configuration interface for users to select openers, adjust audio settings, and customize visual aspects.
- The overlay has a reset button to reset the current state of the overlay
- The overlay must log errors and significant events for troubleshooting purposes.
- The overlay must be compatible with the latest version of ACT and FFXIV.
- The overlay must be developed using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as per ACT's Custom Overlay guidelines. Use of VITE and React is preferred for minimal engineering requirements.
- The overlay must be easily maintainable and extensible for future updates and additional features.
- The overlay must support a custom data model in JSON for writing an opener including action names, timings, audio cues, and visual assets via key IDs. It should include instructions for providing an AI with an image and asking it to write the opener JSON data model for any class and situation.
- The overlay must support localization for multiple languages.
